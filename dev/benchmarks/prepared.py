"""The prepared weights of two builds, compared by their bytes.

A weight cache entry is <cache>/<key>/{weights, sha256, source}. Its key
hashes the build's preparation identity (build/engine/
WeightPreparationIdentity.hpp), so builds of different identities never share
an entry, and two such builds sharing one cache supersede each other's entries
at every start (DEVELOPMENT.md, Weight preparation). A comparison therefore
gives the baseline its own cache when the identities differ, while the
candidate keeps the cache its other release steps use, and compares bytes,
not keys: the candidate's cache must hold the bytes of every entry the
baseline prepared from the installation, for the same component and source
data when both entries record them.
