"""Assemblies: the directories upstream models are served from.

An assembly is models/.resolved/<SHA-256 of its record>: links to its source
snapshots' files (hub.py) and to metadata derived from a GGUF
(models/.metadata/<key>), and model.json, the record naming its sources and
the identity of every linked file. It never changes once published.
Selection links point to assemblies; one that no selection links and no
server holds is collected.

The paths an assembly links, and what reads each:
  config.json            the target configuration: the MLX config.json, or
                         the one derived from the GGUF (ModelDescriptor.mm
                         inspectSourceModel)
  target/config.json     the same MLX file again, where
                         SafetensorsCheckpoint.mm reads a checkpoint's
                         configuration
  target/<shard>         the MLX safetensors shards (SafetensorsCheckpoint.mm)
  target/<name>.gguf     the GGUF target (GgufTarget.cpp findTargetGguf)
  tokenizer/config.json  the same configuration again, from which the
                         server's AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained chooses the
                         tokenizer class
  tokenizer/<file>       the MLX tokenizer files, or tokenizer.json,
                         tokenizer_config.json and chat_template.jinja derived
                         from the GGUF (server.py --tokenizer)
  draft/config.json, draft/<name>.safetensors
                         the DFlash2 checkpoint (ModelDescriptor.mm,
                         DraftCheckpoint.cpp)
  vision/config.json, vision/<shard>
                         the MLX shards holding vision_tower.*
                         (VisionLoader.cpp, through SafetensorsCheckpoint.mm)
  vision/mmproj.gguf     the GGUF vision projector (VisionLoader.cpp)
