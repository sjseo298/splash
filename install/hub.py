A source is one repository at one commit (Repository): listed by the Hub,

directory. An installation pins every snapshot it links with a ref of its
own, refs/splash/<installation>/<commit>, so neither pruning the cache nor
another installation can remove its files.

huggingface_hub is imported where it is used: the launcher imports the
installer modules before the environment that provides it exists, and the
